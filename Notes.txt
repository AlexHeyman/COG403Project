* "Miraculous Ladybug" appears in both the "Cartoons & Comics & Graphic Novels" and "Anime & Manga" sections. It is a French-Italian-Japanese-South Korean joint production, and French, English, Korean, and Japanese are all original languages for it. For simplicity's sake, it was excluded from both categories in our analysis.
