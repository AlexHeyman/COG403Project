WENDY
Nice picture but you have the wrong number.
STAN
Wendy?
WENDY
No.
STAN
Who's this
WENDY
The person you just sent a dick picture to.
STAN
Aww shit I'm so sorry!!
Wrong number
WENDY
I know. I told you so.

11:49 PM

STAN
This is the number she gave me tho
WENDY
I promise you. I'm not the intended recipient of your lovely photograph.
STAN
you think she gave me a fake number on purpose??
WENDY
Possibly.
STAN
Why would she do that???
WENDY
Maybe you struck her as the sort of man who would send pictures of your private parts if she gave you her real number.
Just a thought.
STAN
But she told me to do it!!!
WENDY
Did she specifically say, “Send me a photo of your penis?”
STAN
No… not like that but I knew what she was getting at
WENDY
Clearly, you didn't.
STAN
Then what was she getting at?
WENDY
I wouldn’t know.
STAN
You think I took down the wrong number maybe? Like I put 6 instead of 8?
WENDY
There's no 6 or 8 in my number.
STAN
Oh shit you're right
WENDY
I think we both know what happened here.
STAN
What? What happened??
WENDY
Seriously?
STAN
What???
She was pretty drunk
Maybe she just messed up
WENDY
You believe whatever you want to believe. You still have the wrong number.
STAN
Yeah
Sorry about this

12:13 AM

STAN
Hey are you a girl?
WENDY
I'm not interested.
STAN
No!!! I'm just asking? Just wanna know if some girl just has a pix of my junk you know
WENDY
You're thinking about that now? Not before you took that picture and sent it to an unconfirmed
number?
STAN
GOD I didn’t know it was the wrong number
What would you do
WENDY
I probably wouldn't send that kind of pictures out in the first place.
STAN
I thought she liked me
Damn it I thought I was gonna get some tonight you know
WENDY
I don't want to know.
STAN
K
So you aren't a girl?
WENDY
I'm going to stop responding now.
STAN
K
Sorry

 

Sat, Mar 13, 2:07 PM

STAN
Hey
You live in South Park by any chance?
We have the same area code so I thought we might be in the same area
NOT WENDY
Why are you still texting me?
STAN
I just wanna know if you live close by
This is gonna be super weird if you do
Like you could be the guy bagging my stuff at whole food and j wouldn't even know
NOT WENDY
I don't work at Whole Foods.
STAN
K cool
So where do you work
NOT WENDY
I'm not answering that.
STAN
I'm not trying to be a creep I just wanna know
This is really bothering me
Not knowing who you are
NOT WENDY
You reap what you sow.
STAN
Aw come on dude
I don't even know if you're a dude
I don't think you're a girl tho
You don't talk like one
NOT WENDY
How does a girl talk like?
STAN
More emoji
NOT WENDY
Σ(‘◉⌓◉’)
STAN
K
So definitely a dude
NOT WENDY
Does that make you feel better?
STAN
Uhhhh not really
Now I know some guy I don't know saw my dick
I didn’t sign up for this
NOT WENDY
And I've seen the dick of some guy I don't know so really who has it worse here?
STAN
kkkkkk i’m sorry
Sorry you had to see my dick
Hey what did you do with the pix
NOT WENDY
I put it up on Tumblr.
STAN
For real?
Is it getting notes?
I want my dick to be tumblr famous
NOT WENDY
You're unbelievable.
STAN
Hey you were the one who said it was lovely
You could use it for an aesthetic instagram post
NOT WENDY
Technological limitations prevent me to convey sarcasm through text.
I deleted it. Obviously.
No one is going to use your picture for an aesthetics post.
STAN
I would
NOT WENDY
I question your aesthetic taste.
STAN
Not my fault you can’t appreciate a beautiful thing
What's your name
NOT WENDY
Why?
STAN
So I can save it in my phone to this number?
NOT WENDY
What am I saved under now?
STAN
Not Wendy
NOT WENDY
That seems accurate enough. I can live with that.
STAN
Oh come on
I’m Stan btw
NOT WENDY
Hi Stan btw.
I’ve never seen that last name before.
It’s interesting.
STAN
-_-
A name
That’s all i want
Come on
NOT WENDY
How about you change it to “Person I Should Stop Bothering?”
STAN
Am I bothering you
NOT WENDY
No, I'm having a tremendously enjoyable time.
STAN
K I don't need a fancy app to know your being sarcastic
NOT WENDY
*You're.
STAN
Oooh you're one of those people
Figure
You sound kinda stuck up
NOT WENDY
Appreciating good grammar doesn't make me a stuck-up.
STAN
Yeah it does
And an asshole on top of that
I wasn't even being rude or anything
What's so bad about asking for your name
I was just trying to get to know you
NOT WENDY
Why would you want to do that?
STAN
Idk
Cuz you keep responding to my texts?
Kinda sound to me you wanna talk so…
NOT WENDY
I was being polite.
I can block you in a second.
STAN
K
Then block me

 

Mon, Mar 15, 9:22 AM

STAN
Hi
Did you really block me?
NOT WENDY
I think I should’ve.
STAN
lol
Sup dude
Hey look sorry I called you an asshole
And for being pushy
This whole thing is just weird and messed up and I was really embarrassed and frustrated
It’s not your fault I got the wrong number
So yeah I'm sorry man again for what i said and the pix
You don't have to talk to me anymore if you don't wanna
I just wanted to get that off my chest

11:07 AM

NOT WENDY
It's Kyle.
STAN
Hey Kyle :)
So we cool?
KYLE
I’m debating.
In the meantime, I guess I’ll set your contact picture.
Can you get me one with a better angle? The one you sent has bad lighting.
STAN
Uhhhh
KYLE
I'm kidding.
Don't send me more nudes.
STAN
Not gonna be a problem my man
Hey I thought you said you deleted it
KYLE
I lied.
STAN
…
What are you gonna do with it
KYLE
Nothing nefarious.
STAN
D:
Tell me
Please
Don’t put it on a porn site
Please
Please I’m begging you
KYLE
You’re okay with it posted on Tumblr but not on a porn site.
STAN
PLEASE
DON’T SHAME ME LIKE THAT
KYLE
I won’t.
Not right now, anyway.
STAN
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
KYLE
I’m keeping it for leverage.
STAN
WHAT??
For what????
KYLE
We’ll see.
STAN
I made a huge mistake.
KYLE
Yes, you have.
STAN
I’m deleting you.
KYLE
Bye.

 

Wed, Mar 17, 4:04 PM

STAN
Hey you never answered me
You live in south park?
KYLE
I swear I’m not your neighbor or the guy making your coffee.
STAN
I know that
I’m just asking a general question
KYLE
Asking where I live is not a very general question.
STAN
Not gonna stalk you
Promise
Just curious
Maybe I know you or something
KYLE
You don’t know me.
STAN
How can you know for sure
KYLE
I’d never befriend someone who sends nudes.
STAN
It WASN'T EVEN MEANT FOR YOU
You got lucky
KYLE
You and I have very different definition of luck.
STAN
So? Do you?
KYLE
Yes, and no.
STAN
?
KYLE
I go to school in Denver right now.
STAN
Oh you're still in school?
Wait shit you aren't like 13 are you???
KYLE
Maybe you should lead with that question next time.
Before the “are you a girl” one.
STAN
Are you??
I'm serious you gotta tell me
I’m in enough trouble as it is
KYLE
I'm not 13.
STAN
K
Whew
Thank god
How old are you
KYLE
That’s not a general question again.
How old are you?
STAN
22
Now you
KYLE
A year younger than you.
When is your birthday?
STAN
Uuhh 10/19
You?
KYLE
May.
What's your social security number?
STAN
…
Not cool
KYLE
It was worth a shot.
STAN
I legit don't even know that off the top of my head
KYLE
You don't know?
STAN
What would I even need it for
KYLE
A lot of things, actually.
You should ask your mom for it.
STAN
What no
I'm not gonna ask my mom
KYLE
Ask your dad then.
STAN
lol dude my dad probably don’t even know his own social security number
Or what social security is
He’s a joke
KYLE
You don’t know yours either.
STAN
Uhhhhh
Which is totally his fault
Obvs
KYLE
You should really know your own social security number though.
It’s important.
Go find out and then tell me.
STAN
lololol
Yeah right
I’m not stupid
KYLE
You could’ve fooled me.
STAN
Dude
My feelings
Don’t attack them like that
What did i ever do to you
KYLE
[image]
STAN
GET OVER IT
OMG
You really didn’t delete it
Why are you holding onto my pix like that
Creep
KYLE
Scroll up.
STAN
Oh right
Leverage
So you go CU Denver/
?*
KYLE
Yes.
STAN
woof
Smartie pants
KYLE
Not really. I could’ve gone somewhere better.
Did you just bark at me?
STAN
No
yes
I don’t know why i did that
At least you're in college? I went to SPCC then dropped out :\
KYLE
You didn't transfer?
STAN
Naw school's not really my thing
KYLE
I can tell by your lack of punctuation.
STAN
Sorry COMMA I don't talk like an auto-correct PERIOD
KYLE
Auto-correct doesn’t fix punctuation, only spelling.
STAN
Read this
Tell me what it says
ADK1268
KYLE
Why?
STAN
I’m checking if you’re a bot
KYLE
With a reCAPTCHA…?
STAN
Yeah
Are you a bot
Are you here to enslave humanity and make us use oxford comma
KYLE
I don’t have to answer that.
Oxford Comma is important.
STAN
YOULL NEVER TAKE ME ALIVE
KYLE
We’ll see.

 

Fri, Mar 19, 10:16 AM

STAN
Yo
How’s it going dude?
KYLE
Oh, it’s you again.
STAN
BACK AT IT AGAAAAIN
sup
KYLE
Do you really want to know or are you just asking?
STAN
I really wanna know
But now i’m kinda afraid to know
What’s going on
KYLE
I want to strangle my roommate.
But what else is new?
STAN
Oh?
It’s all new to me
Talk to me man
Fill me with your juicy gossip
KYLE
Don’t ever put those words together in that way again.
STAN
lol
I don’t know what you’re talking about ;)
So what’s happening?
KYLE
I found out this morning my roommate’s been using my toothbrush to clean the toilet.
STAN
HOLYYYY SHIIIT
WHAT THE FUCK
THAT’S MESSED UP
KYLE
Right?
How can anyone be that huge of an asshole? He’s the worst. He’s rude. He has no common courtesy. He has no respect for me or for anyone for that matter.
All he does is fart and make a mess and insult me for being Jewish.
STAN
You’re Jewish?
KYLE
Yes.
Is that a problem?
STAN
Nope
Just happy to know one more thing about you
Anyways sorry to hear that man
Sounds like you got a handful
KYLE
I can’t stand him.
STAN
Put hot sauce in his shampoo
KYLE
I don’t even know if he washes his hair, to be honest.
STAN
Laxative in his food
Make him shit his pants
KYLE
Then I’d have his shit in my washer, which can then contaminate my clothes.
STAN
Damn
Good point
Punch him in the nuts
KYLE
Okay.
STAN
You gonna do it?
KYLE
I’ll think about it.
STAN
Do it
For the vine

6:11 PM

STAN
Did you do it
KYLE
No.
STAN
That sucks
I’d kick his ass for you if I were there
KYLE
I appreciate the thought but I don’t think you’d want to be anywhere near his ass.
It’s toxic.
STAN
D:

KYLE

STAN

KYLE
Wow. Are you going to be okay?
Do you need help?
My dad’s a lawyer.
STAN
NO
LET HUM ROT
I’m so done with him
He’s ALWAYS LIKE THIS he doesn’t think
He just goes do these stupid fucking shit and expect us to clean up after him
And he never holds himself responsible for what he does
It’s always someone else’s fault
KYLE
I’m sorry you have to deal with that, Stan.
Are you going to be okay?
Is there anything I can do?
STAN
I’m fine
Not like this is the first time we had to deal with him
Sorry to drop all that on you man

You want to hear a joke about potassium?
STAN

Hey dude
Spring break’s coming up soon right?
KYLE
Yes.
STAN
You coming back home?
KYLE
I don’t know. I haven’t decided.
Why?
STAN
Oh cool
Nothing
Just thought we could hang out if you’re gonna be in town
KYLE
Oh.
I don’t think I can do that.
STAN
Uhhh
K
Why not
Promise i’m not gonna force you to look at dog pix
Not a lot anyways
KYLE
I like the way this works right now.
I like the anonymity. There is no pressure.
At the end of the day, you’re still just some guy I never met and don’t have to.
And that’s comforting, I guess.
STAN
Oh
K
I get it
KYLE
I value what we have, but that’s all I can handle right now.
Is that okay?
Can we keep it this way?
STAN
Yeah
Dude it’s totally cool
