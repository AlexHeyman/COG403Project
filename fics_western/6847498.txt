When you look in the mirror and study the words etched along one of your wings, you’re a little confused and more than a little annoyed every time. Mine are clearly superior, aren’t they? sounds quite pretentious and you’ve never taken fools lightly.

Still, such an ego probably means your soulmate will need to be protected; bots with big egos are, in your experience, usually the most fragile.

It’s far from your mind when you see three mechs bickering outside your work—blocking the entryway, more specifically. As you get closer, you see each flaring their wings and roll your optics. You don’t have time for showboats; you’re already late! As you push past them, however, one grabs your arm.

“Let’s get an outside opinion then!” he near-screeches at the other two, turning you around and then turning around for himself, practically shoving his wings in your face. “Mine are clearly superior, aren’t they?”

You blink several times, feeling your own wings flutter in disbelief, as well as anticipation of being used properly for the first time. Your optics slide down toward the words scrawled on the back of his right arm and you recognize your neat Vosian print. You smile slightly, taking your cue.

“You wish, Starscream.”

Before either of you speak another word to each other, you're transforming and streaking skyward to settle the matter.
