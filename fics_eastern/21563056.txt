-Very supportive and interested if you have or find new hobbies. Fascinated by any talents that you may have, even if you don’t think it is something special. Might even want to learn from you, asking you to teach him new things (asking not to be as harsh as Fugo)

-Very affectionate if you are okay with that. But if not, he is respectful. The experience knowing and communicating with Fugo made him realize that some people are not as open to the affection as others. Will quietly ask, if he can hold your hand, cuddle or kiss you

-However, if you are okay with the affection, there is no stopping him. Would definitely use any opportunity to be closer to you. You are cooking? Hugs from behind, putting his head on your shoulder. You decided to rest and read a book? Blankets already in hands coming towards you for the cuddle session. Just being near him or letting his head on your shoulder or lap is enough for him to feel overwhelming happiness and comfort

-Active in general. Enjoys going out and checking new places, whether it’ll be cafes, parks or just a pretty scenery. Would write down the address or mark the location on the map, to take his s/o there later. But if his s/o feels like staying home, he wouldn’t mind. As long as they are together, that’s all he needs

-Would definitely introduce you to the gang, especially to Bruno, as he is Nara’s hero. At first you both would be a bit nervous, but seeing Bruno being happy for both calmed you. Narancia would brag to Mista about you for sure, in revenge Mista would usually tease Narancia about his cute s/o. Abbacchio would be intimidating at first, but seeing the boy smiling and telling the gang about you brought calmness and happiness to his heart.

-In case of dates, he can be corny and romantic. First couple of dates he would be more nervous. He asked for an advice from Bruno on how to make the date ‘’perfect’’ , worrying about different locations and scared of not fitting the ‘’fancy’’ criteria, later realizing that the place doesn’t really matter as long as you are spending time together. After these couple of dates, he gained courage and confidence in taking you out without overthinking
