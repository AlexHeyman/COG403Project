August 7th, 2015
7:12 P.M.

Sawamura Daichi: Hey guys, is anyone online?
HOOT HOOT: IM HERE SAWAMURA
Sawamura Daichi: You know how you helped Tsukishima with blocking during the training camp?
HOOT HOOT: YEAH
HOOT HOOT: MAN that was a good week
Sawamura Daichi: Do you have any thoughts on teaching him to spike better?
Sawamura Daichi: My strength is in receives, Suga and our coach are both setters, and our ace is scared of him, so we don’t really have anyone to teach him.
HOOT HOOT: your ace? the big guy?
Sawamura Daichi: Yeah, Azumane.
HOOT HOOT: because tsukishima’s taller…?
HOOT HOOT: im pretty sure azumane’s still twice his weight
Sawamura Daichi: It’s not the height, he’s just scared of everything.
HOOT HOOT: ...alright
HOOT HOOT: hmmm
HOOT HOOT: first off he needs to trust his setter more
Sawamura Daichi: Easier said than done.
HOOT HOOT: he isnt gonna want to hear this but hes gotta put speed first, let the setter take care of accuracy
HOOT HOOT: id be nowhere w/o a reliable setter
HOOT HOOT: brb im gonna tell akaashi that itll make him happy
Sawamura Daichi: I’ll ask Suga to work with him while still letting him think on his own.
Sawamura Daichi: With Kageyama, I can usually convince him that something’s his own idea, but Tsukishima is too smart for that.
Sawamura Daichi: He’s got a lot of potential, you know.
HOOT HOOT: TRUST ME I KNOW
Sawamura Daichi: How’s Akaashi?
HOOT HOOT: he said “i know” and then told me to leave him alone so he could focus on homework
HOOT HOOT: hes still here though so whos the real winner
HOOT HOOT: (its me)
Sawamura Daichi: Whatever makes you happy.
HOOT HOOT: OH ALSO tsukishima clenches his shoulders a lot
HOOT HOOT: he tries to hit hard with the strength of his muscles rather than the speed of his arm
HOOT HOOT: should be the other way around
HOOT HOOT: if that makes any sense at all
Sawamura Daichi: It does, actually.
HOOT HOOT: get him to be more fluid about it
Sawamura Daichi: Thanks, that was...surprisingly helpful.
HOOT HOOT: IM SMART SOMETIMES YKNOW
Sawamura Daichi: Any advice for Hinata, while we’re at it?
HOOT HOOT: YEAH
HOOT HOOT: EXORCISE HIM TO MAKE SURE THAT QUICK ISNT FUCKIN WITCHCRAFT
HOOT HOOT: then send him to fukurodani so i can see him every day
Sawamura Daichi: No.

Sawamura Daichi: I’m not sure Kuroo would appreciate this.
HOOT HOOT: THATS THE POINT
Sawamura Daichi: Also, how did you manage to do that?

Sawamura Daichi: So a meme is … like an internet fad.  A picture or video or text.  That people find funny for a limited amount of time?
Sawamura Daichi: And a lot of variations are made on it?
Sawamura Daichi: And sometimes these variations are funny, but other times they contribute to killing the meme?

Sawamura Daichi: Suga says hi and that it was nice seeing you guys this weekend.
ur favorite lolcat: ohoho
ur favorite lolcat: ill give you guys some privacy if you want
Sawamura Daichi: We’re just walking home?
Sawamura Daichi: What do you need?
Sawamura Daichi: Asahi says hi too.
Sawamura Daichi: Also, I’m not a dad.

Sawamura Daichi’s nickname is now Dadchi.

ur favorite lolcat: whatever you say
Dadchi: Change that back.
ur favorite lolcat: anyways
ur favorite lolcat: you didn’t hear this from me and i’ll claw you apart if you tell your team but
ur favorite lolcat: i noticed this weekend. nekoma isn’t as close as karasuno is.
ur favorite lolcat: and i need to fix that
ur favorite lolcat: besides me and kenma, it feels like we’re teammates but not friends
ur favorite lolcat: working together but not playing together
ur favorite lolcat: we’re cohesive but not cohesive enough
Dadchi: How do I change my name back?
ur favorite lolcat: ill tell you if you help me
Dadchi: Alright.
Dadchi: How much time do you guys spend together outside of practice?
ur favorite lolcat: uh
ur favorite lolcat: you guys do that?
Dadchi: Yeah. You don’t?
ur favorite lolcat: just me and kenma
Dadchi: Usually we’ll get food together after evening practice. The first-years really like pork buns, so I buy them those a lot.
Dadchi: And the weekend before a tournament, they generally sleep over my house.
ur favorite lolcat: to practice?
Dadchi: No, to watch movies and eat junk food and play video games and that sort of thing.
ur favorite lolcat: oh
ur favorite lolcat: isn’t that kind of hard on you
ur favorite lolcat: and your wallet
Dadchi: It makes them happy. Besides, my house is the only one big enough for all of us.
Dadchi: Also, I’m guessing Kenma’s grades are fine, but four of our starters don’t do too well in school, so it’s my job to make sure they’re getting help.
Dadchi: Oh man, Kageyama has a literature test tomorrow...
Dadchi: Be right back, I have to text him.
ur favorite lolcat: did you actually just type out brb
ur favorite lolcat: that’s precious
Dadchi: Don’t know what that means.
Dadchi: I hope he learns how to study before I’m gone…
ur favorite lolcat: don’t you have any second-years who could hold him to it?
Dadchi: Tanaka and Nishinoya are worse than he is.
Dadchi: Maybe Ennoshita.
ur favorite lolcat: ennoshita?
Dadchi: He’s in line to be captain.
ur favorite lolcat: a captain who isn’t a starter?
Dadchi: He’s the leader of the second-years, and he’s good at understanding people.
Dadchi: Being a good captain has nothing to do with being a good volleyball player.
ur favorite lolcat: this is becoming evident
Dadchi: Okay, I gave you advice, now tell me how to change my name back.
ur favorite lolcat: lol no way
Dadchi: Kuroo.
ur favorite lolcat: this is way too good
ur favorite lolcat: besides its revenge
Dadchi: For what?!
ur favorite lolcat: you and bokuto spammed the chat with 200 messages of bird facts two nights ago and thats just unforgivable
ur favorite lolcat: sorry dad
Dadchi: KUROO.

9:07 P.M.

Dadchi: SUGA WON’T TELL ME HOW TO CHANGE MY NAME BACK.
HOOT HOOT: hahahahahahaha

 

September 9, 2015
12:14 P.M.

ur favorite lolcat: okay so about this buying your first years pork buns thing
Dadchi: It doesn’t have to be pork buns.
Dadchi: Just get them food.  Show that you appreciate them.
ur favorite lolcat: but theyre pains in the ass
Dadchi: They’re your pains in the ass.
HOOT HOOT: dadchi thats the most dadlike thing ive ever heard u say
Dadchi: Do you guys want my help or not?

Dadchi: I told him I’d already relayed the message, but he insisted.
HOOT HOOT: WTF I WANT A PERSONAL MESSAGE FROM HINATA
Dadchi: Hinata says he thinks you’re very cool.

HOOT HOOT: NAH BRO I THINK HE’S JUST EXCITED
ur favorite lolcat: for good reason
ur favorite lolcat: karasuno hasn’t been to nationals in a while, right?
Dadchi: Not since before my time.
Dadchi: And if I had to admit it … I’m really excited, too.
Dadchi: I remember in my first year, the captain said we’d try to go to nationals.  And it seemed like an impossible goal at the time, but he told us that if we ever had the opportunity - strong players, good teamwork - we should work as hard as we could to seize that opportunity.
Dadchi: And now it’s really happened.  It feels a little surreal.  But I’m so proud of everyone on the team.
Dadchi: Shit.
HOOT HOOT: sawamura are you crying?
Dadchi: Why would you ask that?
ur favorite lolcat: hes definitely crying
ur favorite lolcat: dont be ashamed bro
