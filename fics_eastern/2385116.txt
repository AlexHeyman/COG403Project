Thursday Morning, October 9th

(11:15) I am going to MURDER that cocky little DICKFACE

(11:18) Wrong number. I hope.

(11:19) Though, out of curiosity, does whoever it is you’re going to murder /literally/ have a dick on or for his face, and/or was that expert pun intentional?

(11:21) Ha sorry, my brother got a new number

(11:22) He doesn’t, and it wasn’t, but it’s fitting

(11:22) And it might as well be Game of Puns because he filled my bunk with dildos

(11:24) Not sure that a bed full of dildos will give you a pass for justifiable homicide.

(11:25) What did you do to incur that sort of… creative retribution?

(11:27) Uh well

(11:28) I might have written his number on a stall in the boy’s washroom with the caption ‘mind-blowing blowjobs, student rates’.

(11:29) I think he got a good response

(11:30) As far as wrong number texts go, I feel like I’m making an impression

(11:32) A fairly phallic one, yes.

(11:33) Game of Puns, A Song of Dongs & Fellatio.

(11:35) HA

(11:36) I have to go to class, Wrong Number, but thanks for the laugh

(11:37) Anytime.

Thursday Evening, October 9th

(6:50) I thought you wouldn’t want to be left hanging re: my dick epic

(6:51) Pun again unintended

(6:52) And wow that makes it sound like I want to tell you the magnum opus of my own dick

(6:53) Which, uh, I don’t

(6:55) I get the feeling you don’t think much before you speak. Or, in this case, type.

(6:56) Not as much as I apparently should

(6:58) Did you murder him with the dildos?

(7:00) Thought that would be too obvious, so no

(7:01) But my brother and I did pelt them at him from the dais while he was on parade march

(7:03) Because that’s not obvious at all.

(7:04) Are you in the military? Seems rather unprofessional to whip dicks at one another, regardless of the need for revenge.

(7:06) Nah, I’m in military school

(7:08) Huh. It’s obviously not as intense as I’ve been led to believe.

(7:09) Are you at Royal Amestris?

(7:10) Yup. Take it you’re not?

(7:11) No, bit too pretentious for my tastes. No offence.

(7:12) None taken. It IS pretentious

(7:13) I’m only here because it’s ‘family tradition’

(7:14) And because Captain Assface pays for it

(7:16) Dare I ask…?

(7:18) My dad

(7:19) Ah.

(7:14) I go to public school.

(7:16) And how’s that?

(7:17) Full of as many dicks, and in similar capacities.

(7:19) High school probably wouldn’t be high school without dicks

(7:20) Whatever the capacity

(7:22) True enough.

(7:23) Thank you for the update, but I have to go. Good luck in the likely continuation of your Dick Epic.

(7:25) Thanks, man

Friday Morning, October 10th

(10:15) I may regret this should you actually turn out to be a stalker, serial killer, or pervert, but I’m not a dude.

(10:16) Are you a dude? Amestris Royal is co-ed, right?

(10:18) It is and I am

(10:19) And not that you have any reason to believe me, but I’m not a stalker or a serial killer

(10:20) Maybe a bit of a pervert, but I figure that all the dicks kinda give that away

(10:22) I think everybody ever is a least a little bit of a pervert.

(10:23) Even my Granny likes to make dick jokes.

(10:25) She sounds awesome

(10:27) She is.

(10:28) Why doesn’t a chicken wear pants?

(10:29) Idk, why?

(10:31) Because his pecker is on his head.

(10:32) HAHA omg

(10:33) Okay, okay

(10:34) What do you get when you cross an owl and a rooster?

(10:36) I don’t know, what?

(10:37) A cock that stays up all night long

(10:38) Oh, Jesus.

(10:39) What do you call a woman who likes small dicks?

(10:40) Idk, idk

(10:41) Hopefully your girlfriend.

(10:42) LOL

(10:43) Christ on a cracker

(10:43) I’m going to use that one on Ling

(10:44) (that’s the dude we pelted the dildos at)

(10:45) What do you call a well-endowed puppet?

(10:47) No idea.

(10:48) Well strung

(10:49) Lucky my chemistry teacher is about observant as a brick wall, I just snorted SO loud. That is TERRIBLE!

(10:50) The best jokes are bad ones

(10:51) Do you actually snort?

(10:52) Ugh. Yeah. Granny says It's ‘endearing’. It’s actually pretty embarrassing.

(10:53) That’s adorable

(10:55) K, I got another one

(10:56) What do you call an erection you get when listening to hymns?

(10:58) Wildly inappropriate?

(10:59) An organ boner

(11:01) Jeez.

(11:03) I’m trying to remember more. She’s probably told me a million.

(11:04) Speaking of wildly inappropriate

(11:05) That’s a perfect way to describe Granny, actually. Hmm. You wouldn’t think terrible penis jokes would be this hard to call to mind.

(11:06) *ba dum bum*

(11:07) Heh.

(11:09) Why do men have a hole in their penis?

(11:10) Do tell

(11:11) So their brains can get some oxygen now and then.

(11:12) OUCH

(11:13) What did the right nut say to the left nut

(11:14) ?

(11:16) Couldn’t say.

(11:18) Don’t talk to the guy in the middle, he’s a dick

(11:20) Hurr, hurr.

(11:22) Last one, I have to go to lunch.

(11:23) K

(11:24) What do you call a herd of cows masturbating?

(11:25) I’m almost afraid to ask

(11:27) Beef strokin’ off.

(11:28) OH MY LANTA

(11:29) *bows* Thank you, thank you. I’m here all week, don’t forget to tip the waitress.

(11:30) Christ I laughed so hard I think I’m going to vomit

(11:31) That’s just indecent

(11:32) Just doing my part to carry on the family legacy.

(11:33) You’re a credit to your name, whatever it is

(11:34) Enjoy your lunch, Queen of Dick Jokes

Friday Afternoon, October 10th

(1:04) who were you texting in chemistry

(1:05) looked like a pretty hilarious conversation THAT YOU DIDN’T SHARE

(1:06) chem is boring as shit, i could’ve used a laugh

(1:07) The guy who wrong-number-texted me about his dildo war.

(1:08) We were telling penis jokes.

(1:09) ...

(1:10) that leaves me with more questions than answers, winry

(1:11) whhhhhhhhhhhy

(1:13) I don’t know. He texted me again to update me re: dicks, and. I don’t know.

(1:15) you said yourself he seems like an ass

(1:16) He IS an ass.

(1:17) But he’s pretty funny.

(1:18) this is weird

(1:19) what if he’s a cunning cyber predator

(1:20) I don’t get that impression.

(1:21) well no, you WOULDN’T if he’s CUNNING

(1:22) i don’t want to see you become a heartbreaking wikipedia article

(1:23) I think you’re making a mountain out of dick jokes.

(1:24) well you’re blushing, so

(1:25) Irrelevant.

(1:26) oh now THAT is bullshit

(1:28) He may have said he thought the idea of my snorting was cute.

(1:29) i’ll get started on your eulogy

(1:31) Texting isn’t meeting him in the deep, dark woods or anything.

(1:32) You’re being dramatic.

(1:34) i’ve told you before, i embrace the hyper-dramatic bc you are not dramatic enough

(1:35) you keep doin your dick joke thing, i’ll just glower with uncomfortableness over here

(1:36) be your intermittent jiminy cricket

(1:37) OH HOW THE TABLES HAVE TURNED

(1:38) ’Uncomfortableness’ isn’t a word.

(1:39) semantics

(1:40) Please don’t get strung out over this. It’s innocent texting, and besides, I’m a big girl. I can take care of myself, you know.

(1:41) you’re my bff, dipshit, and that doesn’t mean i won’t fret

(1:42) just you know, be safe or whatever

(1:43) don’t do anything i wouldn’t do

(1:44) That’s not a very long list.

(1:45) RUDE

Friday Afternoon, October 10th

(2:05) Why are you smiling like such a doofus?

(2:06) It’s getting unnerving.

(2:07) No reason

(2:08) Hmm.

(2:09) What, am I not allowed to smile?

(2:10) You’re the one who said I have to stop looking so murderous all the time

(2:11) Yeah, but usually your forced smiles are creepy.

(2:13) Gee, thanks

(2:14) THAT smile was genuine.

(2:15) Whatever

(2:16) Lan Fan said you were texting all through math.

(2:17) And that you were giggling like a little girl.

(2:18) Well she can go fuck herself

(2:19) And so can you, for that matter

(2:20) Now, now, brother, there’s no need to be belligerent.

(2:22) Says you

(2:23) Ugh STOP looking at me like that or I’m going to deck you

(2:24) It wouldn’t be the first time you got us kicked out of the library.

(2:25) Again, fuck you

(2:26) STOP

(2:27) STOOOOOOOOOOOP

(2:28) You’re so god damn annoying, Al

(2:29) Perk of being the younger brother, Ed.

(2:30) That and getting to blame everything on you.

(2:31) You SUCK

(2:32) You suck SO HARD

(2:33) You suck more dick than LING

(2:34) I’m not going to leave you alone until you tell me.

(2:35) Or until I murder you

(2:26) Yeah but then who would help you fling around dildos during drills?

(2:27) (The answer is nobody, because DILDOS, brother!)

(2:28) Tell me, please?

(2:29) Is it Roooooooooooose?!?!

(2:30) No

(2:31) If something’s making you happy I just want to share that happiness.

(2:32) A touching-seeming statement that is actually code for “I want to make fun of you”

(2:33) Like you wouldn’t do the same thing.

(2:34) Like you DON’T do the same thing, ALL THE TIME.

(2:35) Perk of being the older brother, ALPHONSE

(2:36) You’re a little shit

(2:38) C’mon. Tell me? Please?

(2:39) Fuck fine

(2:40) That person I wrong-number texted, texted me back to say she was a she

(2:41) And then we told dick jokes back and forth until she had to go

(2:44) Well that’s. Random.

(2:46) I know

(2:47) Look it’s not a big deal

(2:48) We probably won’t text again, anyway

(2:49) But she was pretty funny

(2:52) Just. You know. Be careful. If you do. Sometimes people aren’t… who they seem to be.

(2:53) Like you have to tell me that

(2:54) Like I said, it’s not a big deal

(2:55) Can I see the convo?

(2:56) NO

(2:57) Why not? If it’s just dick jokes it’s not like I’m invading your privacy.

(2:58) Because NO

(2:59) Hmm.

(3:00) Seriously, fuck off. I’m going to go study in the room

(3:01) Don’t sulk, brother.

(3:02) Don’t be a nosy little jerk, /brother/

(3:04) Fine, Ed, I’ll leave you to it.

Friday Evening, October 10th

(7:20) Did you actually say ‘oh my lanta’, like from Full House?

(7:21) Not you too

(7:22) What is it shit on Ed day? Did I miss the memo?

(7:23) Why, who else is ribbing on you, ‘Ed’?

(7:24) Shit

(7:25) Ah it doesn’t matter

(7:28) No offense intended, again, but you seem like a very reactionary person.

(7:29) You’re not the first to say so

(7:30) 4 detentions so far this year, ‘temper’ related

(7:31) People are just idiots

(7:32) Sorry

(7:35) You don’t have to apologize, it’s not like we know one another.

(7.36) Though I should probably apologize for making assumptions and/or trying to play psychiatrist. Your life is really none of my business.

(7:38) Well I just unintentionally called you an idiot, so

(7:39) Ugh, whatever, this is stupid

(7:40) My mom was a big Full House fan, I guess

(7:41) She said ‘oh my lanta’ all the time

(7:43) Ah, I see.

(7:45) I have to go again.

(7:46) Right

Friday Evening, October 10th

(9:04) What’s the ultimate rejection?

(9:08) Are we being introspective now?

(9:09) I don’t know if I’m up for self-analysis with a stranger

(9:11) No, it’s a joke.

(9:12) What’s the ultimate rejection?

(9:13) Oh

(9:14) I don’t know, what

(9:16) When you’re masturbating and your hand falls asleep.

(9:18) HA

(9:19) ZING

(9:20) Good night, ‘Ed’.

(9:21) Night, Queen of Dick Jokes.

(9:22) And thanks
